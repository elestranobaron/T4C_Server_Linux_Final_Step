INTL( 2234, "What kind of question is this? Har! I have \"sailed\" many seas and fought "
"beasts as big as the entire village. I am a captain.")

INTL( 2235, "Har! By my grandfather's rotting wooden leg! Balork's curse is just a "

INTL( 2239, "Hardy Har har! Be forewarned, for that these stories be real, says I! Which "
"one do you wish to hear, eh? The story of the giant \"squid\" or when I "
"battled a giant \"whale\"? Or maybe the time I caught a twelve meter long "
"\"trout\"! Har! Har! Maybe I ought to tell you about when I \"drank\" the "
"whole ocean to help one of my crew members from drowning! Hardy Har har! Or "
"my personal favorite story: when I dove in water full of twenty meter, har!, "
"make it forty meter long \"sharks\", to reach an undersea treasure!")

Command(INTL( 2240, "SQUID"))
INTL( 2241, "The sea was angry on that day, I'm tellin' ya! The waves were high "
"and the wind was blowing so hard that giant whales were flying by. Har! But "
"I had a map to the secret location of a squid that had gold in its belly! "
"Har! It took great courage and leadership to brave such a dreadful day. The "
"squid finally decided to come out of its hideout to attack our great ship. I "
"took my favorite harpoon and without thinking about my own life, I charged "
"at the squid. Har! Oh, but you seem in a hurry... Do ya want to know the "
"rest of the story? Har!")

	"of direction. The next thing I knew, I was on the giant squid, standing "
	"just next to its gaping jaw! Har! The beast had razor sharp teeth and could have "
	"swallowed dozens of sharks in a single bite. I lost my harpoon in the "
	"turmoil so I fought with my barehands! I ripped open its belly with my own "
	"teeth! Say there, you look a bit pale. You sure you wanna hear the rest?")

	"squid in the raging storm. I fed on the squid day after day. With my awesome "

Command(INTL( 2247, "WHALE"))
INTL( 2248, "Har! This be the story of my life! Har! I was hunting for a great white "
"whale that had twice before foiled me in combat. I survived, but not before "
"the giant beast had taken one of my legs along with it. Revenge was the only "
"thing I could think of for many years after that. Har! Well... actually, it "
"is quite a long story, but suffice it to say, I vanquished this great, twenty-"
"meter long raging white whale in a fight that shook the whole sea!")

Command(INTL( 2249, "TROUT"))
INTL( 2250, "Har! You don't believe me? I was fishing one day aboard my great vessel and "
"some giant beast grabbed my hook. For thirty days and nights I tried "
"relentlessly to get it out of the water, leading to the greatest battle of all "
"time between man and beast! Har! Har! And finally, I succeeded in taking this "
"giant thirteen-meter trout out of the sea by making it believe the air was "
"better than the water! Ya know what? The beast actually believed me! Har! "
"Har! I really AM a genius! Har!")

Command(INTL( 2251, "DRANK"))
INTL( 2252, "Har! This be a great story, my friend. One day, while me and my crew had just "
"vanquished a bunch of pirates, one of my crewmembers was drunk from the "
"festivities of our great victory and tripped on the bridge, falling into the "
"deep, dark sea. Har! har! As a good captain, I had the obligation of saving "
"the lad. Without consideration for my personal safety, I jumped in the sea, and in one "
"big gulp, I drank it all up! Har har! The crewman then boarded my ship, and "
"I spat out the entire ocean. We then sailed safely back home and were in time for "
"dinner. Hardy har har! What a story eh?")

Command(INTL( 2253, "SHARKS"))
INTL( 2254, "Hardy har har! To this day, no fight like that had even been fought before. "
"Dozens of sharks, fifty meters long, sometimes more, attacked me! My hands "
"were even tied behind my back, for I had just been thrown out into the sea "
"by pirates. I had to fight each and every one of those sharks with my teeth. "
"Har! Blood was spilled I can tell ya! Har! har! I nearly lost an arm, but "
"with my extraordinary fighting skills, I vanquished those overgrown sharks "
"and swam back ashore with only one leg left and my hands still tied up! Har!")
