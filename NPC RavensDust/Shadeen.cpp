//  3: Tells PC about her "secret" (immortality); OPTIONAL VALUE
//  4: PC given mission to rob bank & steal book from Menark
//  5: PC successfully retrieved book from Menark.
//  6: Shadeen retrieved book from PC

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//  Shadeen's Quest is to first poison Rikken Crowbanner in order
//  for the PC to prove he's trustworthy. Then, once she trusts
//  him, she gives him a bit of information about the Obsidian
//  Conclave. She then tells him to go perform criminal deeds
//  (potential for more quests there) and will not give him any more 
//  work until he has gone up three levels and has lost at least 75 
//  points in karma. Once the PC has reached that goal, she will treat
//  him as a friend and will confide that she indeed had a relationsip
//  with Kalastor on Arakas, but does not want to return because she
//  is afraid of her own feelings towards him. She may also tell the
//  Player a secret: she's become immortal after drinking the blood
//  of an Elf (!!!). She then gives the PC a new quest: to kill Iago
//  Caballero, a troublesome adventuring knight who has been thwarting
//  her plans for the last few years. Caballero has a potion of 
//  revival, so he is always revived a day or so after being killed,
//  but that usually leaves Shadeen enough time to complete her
//  devious ploys. When the PC returns, she needs him and a "friend"
//  to do a mission for her: one must go to the bank and "fake" a
//  robbery while the other goes to Menark (chronicler) to mug him and
//  retrieve part of a book called "Chronicles of Doom," relating the
//  First Coming. This is a tricky quest: Player A (bank robber) must
//  do his work before Player B starts his, or the guards will swarm
//  Player B and the mission will fail. Upon receiving the book, she
//  will reward Players A and B with an item that she doesn't need
//  but they might find useful, a Silver Feather, a magical item
//  that can be used to perform a teleport ritual to Stoneheim.
