//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//  Monsignor Damien has been banished from the Church of Artherk a few
//  years ago. He was, back then, a very ambitious man looking to rise
//  quickly in the ranks of the church, and has been fairly successful
//  to date. When Shadeen arrived in town, having only recently become
//  immortal after drinking a special potion, she began stirring up
//  trouble and quickly clashed horns (so to speak) with Monsignor
//  Damien Malakai. Their underground confrontation drew little
//  attention, but caused many unexplained hardships to the people of
//  Silversky and the Kingdom of Goldmoon more specifically. There came
//  a time, however, when Shadeen got the upper hand through a traitor
//  in the church, and she framed Msgr. Damien, leading his superiors
//  to believe he had been spreading heresy. Damien was thrown out of
//  the church and was nearly driven mad by grief. While he acts all
//  nice and apparently honest, he's really very manipulative, trying
//  to get adventurers to side against him and to kill her. Upon finding
//  likely prospects, he summons minions that appear to work for Shadeen,
//  but actually work for him, so the PC believes she's turned against
//  him/her. After that, when the PC finally "realizes" that Shadeen has
//  betrayed him/her, s/he will ask Damien for help, which the devious
//  ex-priest will be delighted to give. At this point, he suggest that the
//  PC has his/her weapon enchanged for Elven Slaying, since he knows that
//  Shadeen has some Elven blood, and s/he can then "take care" of her.
