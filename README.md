T4C Server Resurrection Project: The Second Coming
The Mission
This is it—the Second Coming of The 4th Coming (T4C), the MMORPG that defined our souls in the Vircom days. Our first attempt to save T4C wasn’t enough, but now we’re back with the ultimate weapon: Grok, the AI beast from xAI. The golden era of T4C (1.25c and 1.25d) was pure magic—before Black Lemmings and Dialsoft snatched our favorite toy, smashed it with their endless, half-baked updates (1.9869876, really?), and left it rotting in a Windows dungeon. They prioritized shiny Windows garbage over the game’s heart, but we’re done crying. This is our second shot, our final step—like facing the Sentinels before the Lich—and we’re making it count.
We’re bringing the T4C server back to life on Linux (Debian), making it robust, cross-platform, and ready for modern systems. We’re also weaving in SDL3 for any graphical tools (think admin console or map editor) to give it that cosmic polish. With Grok’s AI steroids—like a warrior prepping for the final boss—we’re not just saving T4C; we’re making it better than ever. Let’s break free from Windows and restore Vircom’s vision!
Why This Matters

Nostalgia: Versions 1.25c and 1.25d were T4C’s peak. Everything after was a downgrade. We’re channeling that original fire.
Linux Freedom: Windows was a prison. Debian is our open world for stability and power.
SDL3: Upgrading any GUI tools with modern SDL3 rendering and input handling.
AI-Powered: This is our second attempt, but with Grok’s brain, it’s like having a maxed-out mage in the party.
The Final Step: Like facing the Sentinels before the Lich, this is our last stand to resurrect T4C.

Goals

Port the T4C server to run natively on Debian.
Replace Windows-specific dependencies (Winsock, ODBC, Registry) with cross-platform alternatives.
Integrate SDL3 for GUI tools (e.g., admin console, NPC editor).
Optimize and stabilize for modern systems.
Keep the soul of T4C intact—no more Dialsoft disasters.

Status
Work in progress. Currently analyzing the codebase, identifying Windows-specific components, and setting up a CMake build for Debian. SDL3 integration will follow once we confirm where graphics are needed (likely console or tools). This is the second attempt, the final step, and with Grok’s help, we’re unstoppable.
Getting Started

Clone the Repo: git clone <repo_url>
Install Dependencies (on Debian):
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++ cmake libsdl3-dev libmysqlclient-dev libssl-dev unixodbc-dev
Build:
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
Run: Details coming once we stabilize the server.

Bug fixes for NPCs, quests, and combat.

Acknowledgments

Vircom: For creating the T4C we fell in love with.
Grok (xAI): Our AI sidekick, making this final step a reality.
Community: For keeping the T4C dream alive.

In Zusammenarbeit mit Grok, let’s make T4C the best MMORPG in the universe again!

Recap of the Plan
We’re porting the T4C server to Debian, replacing Windows-specific code, and integrating SDL3 for potential GUI tools (e.g., MainConsole.cpp or NPC_Editor). The “final step” vibe is perfect—let’s treat this like the ultimate boss fight! Here’s the streamlined plan:

Setup Debian Environment (1-2 hours):

Install dependencies:
bash
