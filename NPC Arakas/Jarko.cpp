INTL( 731, "The name is the Great Jarko to you and it will be the last you will ever "
"hear if you attempt to thwart my \"plans\" of conquest. With this \"spellbook\" "
"in my hand, nothing shall stand in my way, not even \"Makrsh\" \"P'Tangh\" and "
"especially not you.")

INTL( 735, "Araknor might practice the same dark art as I do, but he really is no "
"match for my powerful magic. In fact, he can barely fight one of my "
"goblins. Some day, he is bound to make a mistake that will cost him his "
"life, and then I shall enslave him as one of my undead minions.")

"be easily replaced if they are defeated. By my grandfather's rotting leg, "
"if one goblin dies, I can even channel a small portion of my magical energy and "
"animate his lifeless body. Nothing can stop me! Ha ha ha!!")

"dare to challenge me.")
